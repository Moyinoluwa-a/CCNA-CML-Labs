# CCNA Labs with CML

I’m currently rebuilding every CCNA lab from Jeremy's IT Lab using Cisco Modeling Labs (CML). I started this project to sharpen my hands-on skills and document my learning journey, hoping it not only inspires others but also opens doors in the networking world.

## Motivation

Preparing for my CCNA exam (June 2025) with one goal: to be hands-on confident before I sit the exam. 

## Conclusion

Thanks for checking out my CCNA journey. If you’re hiring for networking roles, or if you're looking to collaborate on projects, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to new opportunities and learning from the best.
